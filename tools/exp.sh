# The set: the 60 M Linux lockstep (retires; the lockstep is the correctness check), Dhrystone and
# CoreMark in lockstep (workloads/rvbench, cycles), the four pi checkpoint slices and the five GB5
# checkpoint slices (20 M retires warm, 50 M measured; cycles). M5 runs the locksteps and pi,
# fastmac the GB5 slices. SET=sp runs workloads/gb5/simpoints.txt's 77 by the hosts' measured
# throughput (2026-10-21: a point takes 674 s on fastmac 12 at a time, 764 s on M5 9 at a time,
# 1046 s on mercury 12 at a time): of every seven three on fastmac, two on M5, two on mercury --
# or, when no Vivado build runs on coffee (Tommy, 2026-10-20: sims on coffee only between builds),
# of every nine two more on coffee (mercury: 192.168.1.166, Linux, its checkpoints and trees on
# its local disk, /scratch/tommy; M5 and coffee: ~/gb5ck/sp),
# points instead (the same 20 + 50 M each), and the table totals them into each subtest's cycles.
# All runs start together, at most J at a time per kind, the kinds side by side: the runners build
# a stale model once under their build lock and then run from it together. The tree is copied
# with rsync (tracked and untracked-not-ignored files, no platforms/), so an uncommitted edit is
# measured as it stands. Results land in ~/exp-results/<tag>/ on coffee: a
# log per run, and the table in table.txt; the hosts' copies go once the logs are in.
