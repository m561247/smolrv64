// The physical register file's shards. A physical register is {shard[2:0], index}: the lanes'
// integer shards are 0..3 (lane k's is k), the FP file's two 4 and 5, one per writer (SH_FL the
// load landing's, SH_FF the F stage's), so a register is an f-register exactly when shard[2] is
// set. A width-IW core uses lanes 0..IW-1.
