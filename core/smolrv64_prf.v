// Sharded physical register file for smolrv64_core.
//
// WHY SHARDS.  A register file with one write port cannot take the results of units that
// complete out of order in the same cycle, and duplicating the array does not help: every
// copy must receive every write, so replication buys READ ports and never WRITE ports.  The
// cheap way to more write ports is to bank by WRITER, so each bank has exactly one, and that
// requires knowing the destination bank at rename.  That is what renaming buys here.
//
// THE INTEGER SHARDS, one per lane (smolrv64_shards.vh): lane k's shard is written by lane
// k's write register alone, which carries its ALU and multiply results and the landings
// (loads, AMOs, CSR reads, the FP ops' integer results, divides).
//
// THE FP FILE holds f0-f31 and nothing else, in a shard per writer: SH_FL is the load
// landing's (FP loads), SH_FF the F stage's (FP results), each written through the address,
// data and wakeup broadcast its writer already has (we_ld, we_fe). Rename knows the writer of
// every f-register it allocates, so the register's number says which shard holds its value, and
// no write ever waits for the other.
//
// SIZING IS A CORRECTNESS FLOOR, not just performance.  A shard must hold every
// architectural register that can map into it, PLUS at least one free, or rename deadlocks:
// with every register mapped and none free, nothing can be renamed, so nothing can commit,
// so nothing is ever freed.  Every integer shard can hold all 32 integer registers, and each
// FP shard all 32 FP registers, so each must exceed 32.  Above that floor it is a stall/area
// choice, and smolrv64_rename exports per-shard stall counters so the choice can be replaced
// by a measurement.
//
// Physical register number: {shard[2:0], idx[IDXB-1:0]}.  Shard in the HIGH bits so a
// shard's pool is a contiguous range and its free list is a plain counter range.
// Physical register 0 is the architectural zero: never written, always reads 0.
//
// THE READS are combinational and there is no write-through: a consumer reads a register two
// cycles after its producer was selected, and the core forwards from the lanes' write
// registers for the one cycle a write is still in flight.
